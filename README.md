# obj-mixer

Using this program you can select all or some of the groups in one or more obj files and output them together in an obj file.

## Requirements
Needs .NET Framework v2 or higher.

So, Windows only. (unless you hack it to use Mono Develop, I don't know how)

## Other features
Another feature is if a group is listed with the same name in separate sections the program will list the group contiguously.

Also it removes duplicate and unused vertices.

## Usage
1. Load models in.
2. Tick which models you want involved.
3. Selecting a model in the model list displays the group list for that model.
4. Tick which groups of that model you want involved.
5. Click Combine. (even for just one)
6. Save the file.
